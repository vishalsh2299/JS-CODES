          JavaScript , often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that
          conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level,
          often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket
          syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and
          first-class functions.The Mosaic web browser was released in 1993. As
          the first browser with a graphical user interface accessible to
          non-technical people, it played a prominent role in the rapid growth
          of the nascent World Wide Web. The lead developers of Mosaic then
          founded the Netscape corporation, which released a more polished
          browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994. Navigator quickly became the
          most used browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          During these formative years of the Web, web pages could only be
          static, lacking the capability for dynamic behavior after the page was
          loaded in the browser. There was a desire in the burgeoning web
          development scene to remove this limitation, so in 1995, Netscape
          decided to add a scripting language to Navigator. They pursued two
          routes to achieve this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed
          the Java programming language, while also hiring Brendan Eich to embed
          the Scheme language.Netscape management soon decided that the best
          option was for Eich to devise a new language, with syntax similar to
          Java and less like Scheme or other extant scripting languages.
          Although the new language and its interpreter implementation were
          officially called LiveScript when first shipped as part of a Navigator
          release in September 1995, the name was changed to JavaScript three
          months later.The choice of the JavaScript name has caused confusion,
          sometimes giving the impression that it is a spin-off of Java. Since
          Java was the hot new programming language at the time, this has been
          characterized as a marketing ploy by Netscape to give its own new
          language cachet.

          Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of
          the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an
          essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use
          it for client-side page behavior, and all major web browsers have a
          dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.Microsoft debuted Internet
          Explorer in 1995, leading to a browser war with Netscape. On the
          JavaScript front, Microsoft reverse-engineered the Navigator
          interpreter to create its own, called JScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven,
          functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application
          programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular
          expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model
          (DOM). However, the language itself does not include any input/output
          (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, as the
          host environment (usually a web browser) provides those APIs.Script
          was first released in 1996, alongside initial support for CSS and
          extensions to HTML. Each of these implementations was noticeably
          different from their counterparts in Navigator. These differences made
          it difficult for developers to make their websites work well in both
          browsers, leading to widespread use of "best viewed in Netscape" and
          "best viewed in Internet Explorer" logos for several years.

          In November 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to ECMA International,
          as the starting point for a standard specification that all browser
          vendors could conform to. This led to the official release of the
          first ECMAScript language specification in June 1997.

          Meanwhile, Microsoft gained an increasingly dominant position in the
          browser market. By the early 2000s, Internet Explorer's market share
          reached 95%. This meant that JScript became the de facto standard for
          client-side scripting on the Web.Microsoft initially participated in
          the standards process and implemented some proposals in its JScript
          language, but eventually it stopped collaborating on ECMA work. Thus
          ECMAScript 4 was mothballed.

        <p>
          During the period of Internet Explorer dominance in the early 2000s,
          client-side scripting was stagnant. This started to change in 2004,
          when the successor of Netscape, Mozilla, released the Firefox browser.
          Firefox was well-received by many, taking significant market share
          from Internet Explorer.Meanwhile, very important developments were
          occurring in open source communities not affiliated with ECMA work. In
          2005, Jesse James Garrett released a white paper in which he coined
          the term Ajax and described a set of technologies, of which JavaScript
          was the backbone, to create web applications where data can be loaded
          in the background, avoiding the need for full page reloads. This
          sparked a renaissance period of JavaScript, spearheaded by open source
          libraries and the communities that formed around them. Many new
          libraries were created, including jQuery, Prototype, Dojo Toolkit, and
          MooTools.Google debuted its Chrome browser in 2008, with the V8
          JavaScript engine that was the first to use just-in-time compilation,
          significantly improving execution times. Other browser vendors needed
          to overhaul their engines to compete.In July 2008, these disparate
          parties came together for a conference in Oslo. This led to the
          eventual agreement in early 2009 to combine all relevant work and
          drive the language forward. The result was the ECMAScript 5 standard,
          released in December 2009.
        </p>

          In 2005, Mozilla joined ECMA International, and work started on the
          ECMAScript for XML (E4X) standard. This led to Mozilla working jointly
          with Macromedia (later acquired by Adobe Systems), who were
          implementing E4X in their ActionScript 3 language, which was based on
          an ECMAScript 4 draft. The goal became standardizing ActionScript 3 as
          the new ECMAScript 4. To this end, Adobe Systems released the Tamarin
          implementation as an open source project. However, Tamarin and
          ActionScript 3 were too different from established client-side
          scripting, and without cooperation from Microsoft, ECMAScript 4 never
          reached fruition.

        <p>
          Ambitious work on the language continued for several years,
          culminating in an extensive collection of additions and refinements
          being formalized with the publication of ECMAScript 6 in 2015.From
          2016 to 2019, a new version of the ECMAScript standard was published
          each year, but the scope of changes was much smaller than the 5th or
          6th editions. Thus JavaScript can now be considered a mature language
          that has largely settled down.

          The current JavaScript ecosystem has many libraries and frameworks,
          established programming practices, and increased usage of JavaScript
          outside of web browsers. Plus, with the rise of single-page
          applications and other JavaScript-heavy websites, a number of
          transpilers have been created to aid the development process.
