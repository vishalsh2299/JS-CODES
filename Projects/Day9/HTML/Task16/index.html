      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a
      programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
      JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm.
      It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based
      object-orientation, and first-class functions.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform,
      JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web
      browser. Express.js, or simply Express, is a web application framework for
      Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License.
      It is designed for building web applications and APIs. It has been called
      the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.
