        GeekyAnts is a young Product and Services development company based in
        Bangalore. We do everything related to web and mobile app development
        and are extremely passionate about building world-class products. A
        colony of highly skilled developers and designers, we are huge
        contributors in the open-source community. We donâ€™t just consider
        ourselves as coders or designers, but as innovators who love to create
        digital solutions that transform lives and the way people interact on a
        day to day basis. NativeBase, our cross-platform UI components library
        for React Native, is extremely well received by developers across the
        world. NativeBase has recently crossed over 13,300+ stars on Github and
        accounts for around 10% of all React Native downloads, which means that
        if there are 100 React Native apps in the market at a time, 10 of them
        have NativeBase components in them! We love to challenge ourselves
        daily. It gives us an opportunity to grow and experiment with new
        technologies, while creating some of the most amazingly innovative apps!
        We host meet-ups and run community oriented meet-up groups, attend
        conferences around the world and always stay on top of our game in order
        to share our knowledge with the developer community that we belong to.
